	<div class="toggle-wrap"> <b>Abstract:</b> 
	In this paper we consider alignment of sparse graphs, for which we introduce the Neighborhood Tree Matching Algorithm (NTMA). For correlated 
	Erdős-Rényi random graphs, we prove that the algorithm returns -- in polynomial time -- a positive fraction of correctly matched vertices, 
	and a vanishing fraction of mismatches. This result holds with average degree of the graphs in O(1) and correlation parameter s that can be 
	bounded away from 1, conditions under which random graph alignment is particularly challenging. As a byproduct of the analysis we introduce a 
	matching metric between trees and characterize it for several models of correlated random trees. These results may be of independent interest, 
	yielding for instance efficient tests for determining whether two random trees are correlated or independent.

	<div class="toggle-wrap"> <b>Abstract:</b> 
	In this paper we analyze a simple method (EIG1) for the problem of matrix alignment, consisting in aligning their leading eigenvectors: given A and B, we 
	compute v1 and v′1 two leading eigenvectors of A and B. The algorithm returns a permutation Π^ such that the rank of the coordinate Π^(i) in v1 is the 
	rank of the coordinate i in v′1 (up to the sign of v′1). We consider a model where A belongs to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), and B=ΠT(A+σH)Π, 
	where Π is a permutation matrix and H is an independent copy of A. We show the following 0-1 law: under the condition σN7/6+ϵ→0, the EIG1 method recovers 
	all but a vanishing part of the underlying permutation Π. When σN7/6−ϵ→∞, this algorithm cannot recover more than o(N) correct matches. This result gives an 
	understanding of the simplest and fastest spectral method for matrix alignment (or complete weighted graph alignment), and involves proof methods and 
	techniques which could be of independent interest.
